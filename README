- PostgreSQL 13
- React (for the frontend)

## Modules

- **filter-api**: Backend API built with Spring Boot.
- **filter-ui**: Frontend UI built with React.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

To run the "Filter" application locally, follow these steps:

1. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
   docker-compose up --build
This command will build the Docker images if they don't exist and start the application containers.

2. Access the application:
Once the application is up and running, you can access it at:
    Frontend: http://localhost:80
    Backend: http://localhost:8080
